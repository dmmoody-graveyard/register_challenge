Review the following technical problem. The solution should be delivered via a Git repository,

JSFiddle, or a ZIP file.

The problem:

A supermarket sells the three products listed below:

● Product A = $20

● Product B = $50 (or five for the price of three)

● Product C = $30

Implement a web application for a supermarket register that allows a user to add products to

their basket and calculates the total for the given collection of products. For example, the

following basket should total up to $240.

● 3x Product A

● 5x Product B

● 1x Product C

Deliver your solution as a Javascript web application using a modern client­side framework such

as Angular, Ember, Backbone, etc. Your solution should be able to run in Chrome.

Consider testability, documentation, and other good coding practices in your solution. Your

application can run exclusively in the browser and doesn’t need to have a server­side

component.

Additional optional challenges:

1. Allow for adding new pricing rules at runtime without restarting/rebuilding/refreshing the

application.
